spam = ['test','hi','hello','test2']

# print(spam.index('hello'))

# if there are duplicates in a list and you search using index, it will return the first time it sees thet index.

# append and insert list methods
# spam.append('test3')
# print(spam)
# added test3 to the list

#
# spam.insert(1,'chicken')
# same as append but inserts chicken at a specific location on the list

# spam.remove('hello') to remove an index from list

# important note : methods can only be called on lists and not strings and integers
